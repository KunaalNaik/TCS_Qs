### Scenario for N8121 - PC4: Resolving Parallel Programming Constraints in a Machine Learning System

**Scenario**:  
You are responsible for optimizing a machine learning model that runs on a distributed autonomous system. The system processes large volumes of data in real-time but suffers from performance issues due to inefficient parallel task execution. Task synchronization is particularly problematic, leading to high overhead and system bottlenecks. In addition, the system's parallel programming architecture needs to be optimized for scalability, ensuring that it can handle increasing data loads without sacrificing performance. Your tasks include optimizing task synchronization, improving CPU utilization, and ensuring efficient data processing across multiple cores.

### Questions for the Scenario

#### Question 1: Task Synchronization Optimization
**Question Type**: Scenario-based (ScB)  
**Question**:  
Write a Python function that optimizes task synchronization in the system’s parallel programming architecture. Your function should use Python’s `multiprocessing` library and implement a lock mechanism to minimize synchronization overhead while maximizing CPU efficiency.

**Answer**:
```python
from multiprocessing import Process, Lock

def task_with_lock(lock):
    with lock:
        # Critical section where shared resources are accessed
        perform_task()

def optimize_task_synchronization(tasks):
    lock = Lock()
    processes = []
    
    for task in tasks:
        process = Process(target=task_with_lock, args=(lock,))
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()
    
    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    return "Task synchronization optimized"
```
**Explanation**:  
This function implements a lock mechanism using Python’s `multiprocessing` library. It ensures that shared resources are accessed safely, minimizing synchronization overhead while maximizing CPU usage by executing multiple processes in parallel.

#### Question 2: CPU Utilization Improvement
**Question Type**: Scenario-based (ScB)  
**Question**:  
Create a Python script that dynamically adjusts the number of parallel processes based on the CPU load. The script should monitor CPU usage and increase or decrease the number of processes accordingly to ensure efficient CPU utilization.

**Answer**:
```python
import os
import psutil
from multiprocessing import Process

def monitor_cpu_usage():
    return psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)

def perform_task():
    # Simulated task
    pass

def adjust_parallel_processes(tasks):
    cpu_usage = monitor_cpu_usage()
    num_cores = os.cpu_count()
    max_processes = num_cores if cpu_usage < 75 else num_cores // 2
    
    processes = []
    for i in range(min(len(tasks), max_processes)):
        process = Process(target=perform_task)
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()
    
    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    return "CPU utilization optimized based on current load"
```
**Explanation**:  
This script dynamically adjusts the number of parallel processes based on the current CPU load. If the CPU usage exceeds 75%, the script reduces the number of processes to avoid overloading the system, ensuring optimal CPU utilization.

#### Question 3: Parallel Data Processing
**Question Type**: Scenario-based (ScB)  
**Question**:  
You need to optimize the parallel processing of large datasets in the system. Write a Python function that uses the `concurrent.futures` library to parallelize the data processing tasks. Ensure that the function scales with increasing data loads and handles task distribution efficiently.

**Answer**:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_data(data):
    # Simulated data processing task
    return data ** 2

def parallel_data_processing(data_chunks):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(process_data, data_chunks))
    return results

# Example usage
data_chunks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = parallel_data_processing(data_chunks)
```
**Explanation**:  
This function leverages Python’s `concurrent.futures` library to parallelize the processing of large datasets. It distributes the data chunks across multiple threads, ensuring efficient task execution and scalability as data loads increase.

#### Question 4: Documentation Update for Parallel Programming
**Question Type**: Scenario-based (ScB)  
**Question**:  
Update the system documentation to include the changes made to the parallel programming architecture. Specifically, explain how the task synchronization and CPU utilization optimizations improve system performance and scalability under high-load conditions.

**Answer**:
```text
### Parallel Programming Optimization

To address the performance bottlenecks caused by inefficient parallel programming, two major changes were made:

1. **Task Synchronization Optimization**:
   A lock mechanism was implemented using Python's `multiprocessing` library to minimize task synchronization overhead. This allows multiple processes to safely access shared resources without causing significant delays. By reducing the synchronization overhead, the system can now process tasks faster, especially during peak data loads.

2. **CPU Utilization Improvement**:
   A dynamic process adjustment mechanism was introduced to monitor CPU load in real-time. The system dynamically scales the number of parallel processes based on current CPU usage. When CPU load exceeds a defined threshold (75%), the system reduces the number of active processes to prevent overloading. This ensures that the CPU is efficiently utilized while avoiding performance degradation under heavy workloads.

These improvements significantly enhance the system's ability to scale and perform under high-load conditions, allowing for efficient parallel processing and optimized resource usage.
```
**Explanation**:  
This documentation explains the changes made to the parallel programming architecture, focusing on how task synchronization and CPU utilization improvements enhance system performance and scalability during high-load scenarios.
